This article details an AI program that can write its own code to solve a plethora of problems. The AI can even interpret plain English commands, such as "give me snow falling on a black background," and output a visual of what was described. It can also solve typical coding interview style problems very quickly, as welll as write its own code. Codex can write in 12 languages, and translate between them. However, as impressive as it sounds, the creators estimate it is only fully accurate about 37% of the time, with lots of the produced code not running, containing security flaws, or producing incorrect outputs. These mistakes could often be quickly fixed by a human tweaking them, but this required the AI to be piloted by a skilled programmer.

This article is very interesting to me because it covers a very topical concern: how quickly is AI evolving, and will it render humans obsolete in the fields it learns? In this case, we see that even as this AI becomes more sophisticated, this type of technology serves more as a very useful tool for software developers rather than a replacement. Skilled workers are needed to operate, command, and interpret the results of Codex. While AI could make people's jobs easier and more efficient, human creations still require humans to use. It's also interesting to observe that even in the computer science field that is resonsible for the AI that threatens other job markets, concerns of an AI takeover of skilled human labor are present and evolving as new technology is developed.
